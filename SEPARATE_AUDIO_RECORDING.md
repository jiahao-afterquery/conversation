# 🎤 Separate Audio Recording Implementation

## Overview
The audio platform now captures each user's audio separately, ensuring that when recording stops, two distinct audio files are uploaded:
- **Local Audio**: Contains only the current user's speech
- **Remote Audio**: Contains only the other user's speech

## 🔧 **How It Works**

### **1. Dual Recording System**
- **Local Recording**: Captures audio from the user's microphone directly
- **Remote Recording**: Captures audio from the remote user's audio track
- **Separate Files**: Each user's audio is stored in separate files

### **2. File Naming Convention**
```
{conversationId}_{userId}_{audioType}_{timestamp}.webm
```
Examples:
- `abc123_user1_local_1234567890.webm` (User 1's audio)
- `abc123_user1_remote_1234567891.webm` (User 2's audio from User 1's perspective)

### **3. Recording Flow**

#### **When Recording Starts:**
1. User clicks "Start Recording"
2. Local audio recording begins (user's microphone)
3. Remote audio recording begins (other user's audio track)
4. Both recordings run simultaneously

#### **When Recording Stops:**
1. User clicks "Stop Recording"
2. Local recording stops and uploads
3. Remote recording stops and uploads
4. Both files are saved to server

### **4. File Upload Process**
```
Recording Stop → Local Audio Upload → Remote Audio Upload → File List Update
```

## 📁 **File Structure**

### **Server Storage:**
```
server/uploads/
├── conversation1_user1_local_1234567890.webm
├── conversation1_user1_remote_1234567891.webm
├── conversation1_user2_local_1234567892.webm
└── conversation1_user2_remote_1234567893.webm
```

### **File Information:**
Each file contains:
- **conversationId**: Links files to specific conversation
- **userId**: Identifies which user uploaded the file
- **audioType**: `local` (user's voice) or `remote` (other user's voice)
- **timestamp**: When the file was created

## 🎯 **User Experience**

### **File Display:**
- **"Your Audio"**: Shows files containing the current user's voice
- **"Other User Audio"**: Shows files containing the other user's voice
- **Clear labeling**: Users can easily identify which audio is theirs

### **Recording Indicators:**
- Real-time recording status
- Visual indicators for both users
- Either user can stop recording

## 🔒 **Privacy & Security**

### **Audio Isolation:**
- Each user's audio is captured separately
- No mixing of audio streams
- Clear separation of user content

### **File Access:**
- Users can only see files from their conversations
- Files are organized by conversation ID
- Secure file storage on server

## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**

### **Frontend Changes:**
- **Dual MediaRecorder**: Separate recorders for local and remote audio
- **Audio Track Capture**: Captures remote user's audio track
- **File Upload**: Uploads both files when recording stops
- **UI Updates**: Shows separate audio files with clear labels

### **Backend Changes:**
- **File Naming**: Includes audioType in filename
- **File Metadata**: Stores audioType in file information
- **File Listing**: Returns audioType in file list
- **Upload Handling**: Processes both local and remote audio files

## 🚀 **Benefits**

### **For Users:**
- ✅ **Clear Audio Separation**: Each user's voice is in separate files
- ✅ **Easy Identification**: Clear labeling of "Your Audio" vs "Other User Audio"
- ✅ **Better Analysis**: Can analyze each user's speech patterns separately
- ✅ **Privacy Control**: Users can manage their own audio files

### **For Analysis:**
- ✅ **Individual Speech Analysis**: Analyze each user's speaking patterns
- ✅ **Conversation Flow**: Track who spoke when
- ✅ **Audio Quality**: Separate quality assessment for each user
- ✅ **Data Processing**: Easier to process individual audio streams

## 🎉 **Result**

When a conversation recording stops, you now get:
1. **Two separate audio files**
2. **Each containing only one user's voice**
3. **Clear labeling and organization**
4. **Easy identification and management**

This creates a much better audio collection system where each user's contribution is clearly separated and identifiable!
